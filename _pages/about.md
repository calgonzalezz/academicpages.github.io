My research interests are related to economic regulation, political economy and development. My current research project uses text mining and topic modeling to explore the relationship between network sector regulators' governance regimes and economic performance. The main goal of this project is to characterize regulatory governance regimes differences across sectors and countries. Moreover, I am interested in establishing a link between 'good' governance and performance. Initially, early results suggest that independence among institutional actors (government, parliament) are correlated differently with performance measures such as prices and investment levels.

I have previous experience about energy, foreign affairs, international trade and competition topics.
