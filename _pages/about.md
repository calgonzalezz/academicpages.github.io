My research interests are related to economic regulation, political economy. My current research project uses text mining and topic modeling to explore the relationship between network sector regulators' governance regimes and economic performance. The main goal of this project is to characterize regulatory governance regimes differences across sectors and countries. Moreover, I am interested in establishing a link between 'good' governance and performance. Initially, early results suggest that independence among institutional actors (government, parliament) are correlated differently with performance measures such as prices and investment levels.

Other research experience

My research experience includes topics in development, foreign Direct investment and Education.  My MSc. Economics thesis uses instrumental variables and gravity based predictors to address and disentangle the relationship between international openness measured by foreign direct investment, and migration flows on economic development and long-run productivity in a cross-section analysis. The results show that the relationship between FDI and migration shares to long-run income is robust even after controlling for institutional, geographical, cultural and colonial features. Additionally, a decomposition analysis demonstrates that FDI affects income through human capital accumulation and residual productivity especially for countries with better institutional quality.

In addition, my MSc. Econometrics thesis attempts to uncover the causal effects of family background and teacher quality on the academic attainment of students in Ecuador for the period 2015-2016. The study finds that parental education and teacher quality have strong effects on students’ academic attainment. In particular, the study finds that for every additional year of parental education there is a 2.1 to 3.2 points increase in the children’s examination scores, and this effect varies across children’s ages. Furthermore, parental education exhibits different effects for households with different levels of education. Households with lower education worsen their children’s educational attainment, while households with higher education improve the educational attainment of students. School resources shows no impact on academic attainment while household resources such as internet access, book availability, and household income show a positive impact on educational outcomes.
